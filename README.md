# **Bitcoin CryptoCurrency Market**

**Overview and Description**
- Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2008, hundreds of similar projects based on the blockchain technology have emerged. We call these cryptocurrencies (also coins or cryptos in the Internet slang). Some are extremely valuable nowadays, and others may have the potential to become extremely valuable in the future. In fact, on the 6th of December of 2017, Bitcoin has a [market capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization) above $200 billion.

**Market Capitalization and Cryptocurrencies**
- At the time of writing, Bitcoin is under serious competition from other projects, but it is still dominant in market capitalization. I'll plot the market capitalization for the top 10 coins as a barplot to better visualize this.

**Visualization**
- Many coins are not comparable to large companies in market cap, so I'll divert from the original Investopedia definition by merging categories.
